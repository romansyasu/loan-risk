# loan-risk

For most financial institutions, such as banks and multi-finance
companies, their main source of income is coming from their lending activities. By
engaging in this activity, it means that lenders are exposed to the potential risk,
where debtors stop repaying their loans, causing losses to the lenders. To mitigate
this loss, lenders are expected to appropriately choose who are qualified for a loan,
at what rate, and at what amount. Here, we are trying to create a model to rank the
loan applicants based on their repayment capability.
